Hello! ðŸ‘‹ These are my solutions for some of the targets on the [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev) website. 
This repository is intended as an archive of my personal practice and exploration of vanilla CSS.
I have aimed for accuracy and readability of code, choosing to forgo the goal of "code-golfing".
If you've stumbled upon this code, feel free to have a look around and leave a comment. ðŸ˜Š
